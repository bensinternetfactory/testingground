# Homepage (`/`) Wireframe & Section Plan

## Context

Designing the TowLoans.com homepage to be the pillar page for "tow truck financing" (~980 monthly search volume, KD 0). The homepage must:
- Convert visitors to pre-approval (primary funnel, built externally)
- Place 13+ internal links to equipment, program, and resource pages for SEO/discoverability
- Hybrid feel: modern SaaS design aesthetic with direct-response conversion principles
- Support secondary funnels (email/SMS nurture for not-ready visitors)

## Section-by-Section Rationale

| Section | Purpose | Why It Earns Its Place |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Hero | First impression + primary CTA | Must convert high-intent visitors immediately |
| 2. Equipment Cards | Intent routing + 4 internal links | Segments users AND feeds 4 SEO pages |
| 3. How It Works | Reduce friction | 3-step process builds confidence to click CTA |
| 4. Revenue Proof | Overcome price objection | "Pays for itself" is the #1 conversion driver |
| 5. Programs | Differentiation + 3 internal links | Shows breadth; 3 cards link to leasing, $0 down, and programs hub |
| 6. Requirements | Kill objections | "No perfect credit needed" removes biggest blocker |
| 7. Social Proof | Build trust | Stats + testimonials + logos before final CTA |
| 8. Calculator Teaser | Capture not-ready visitors | Routes to calculator page (secondary funnel) |
| 9. Resource Hub | SEO link equity + 5 internal links | Feeds 5 resource pages with contextual links |
| 10. FAQ | SEO + remaining objections | FAQPage schema + PAA targeting + inline links |
| 11. Final CTA | Close | Last chance conversion with value recap |
| 12. Footer | Navigation + trust | Full site links + trust badges |

**Every section either converts or places critical internal links. No filler.**

---

## Verification

After implementation:
1. Count internal links: should be 14+ unique destinations on homepage (3 more via footer/hub)
2. Count CTAs: should be 9 conversion points
3. Validate FAQPage JSON-LD with Google Rich Results Test
4. Check all internal link `href` values match sitemap slugs
5. Mobile: verify all sections stack cleanly, CTAs are thumb-reachable
6. Lighthouse: target 90+ performance, 100 accessibility
7. Run `npm run build` to verify no broken routes
