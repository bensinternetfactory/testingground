# Fleet Upgrade Program — AI Explanation Guide

## Purpose
This program helps established towing businesses get financing for tow trucks even if they have never borrowed that much before.

Traditional lenders often limit loan size based on past borrowing history. This program focuses more on business strength instead.

---

## Basic Qualification

A towing business may qualify if they have:

- At least 3 tow trucks in their fleet, OR
- Significant time in business (typically multiple years)

Additional helpful factors:

- Good credit score
- Strong payment history
- Stable operating business

---

## The Core Problem We Solve

Many towing operators:

- Paid cash for their first trucks
- Built their fleet without financing
- Therefore have little or no comparable loan history

Traditional lenders often require:

- Previous similar loan size before approving a larger one
- Large down payments if loan history is smaller

Example:

- Largest prior loan: $100k–$130k
- New truck cost: $155k
- Traditional lender may require $25k–$55k down.

---

## How This Program Is Different

We evaluate:

- Fleet ownership
- Business stability
- Time in business
- Overall creditworthiness

If a business is already established, we may:

- Approve larger loan amounts
- Ignore lack of comparable past loans
- Offer financing with little or no down payment.

---

## Example Scenario

Customer:

- 3 trucks already owned
- 2+ years in business
- Good credit and payment history
- Wants to buy a $155k new wrecker

Traditional result:

- Partial approval only
- Large down payment required

Program result:

- Possible full approval
- Often zero down
- Based on fleet and business strength.

---

## Key Value

This program:

- Helps towing businesses grow faster
- Reduces need for large down payments
- Recognizes operational success instead of just borrowing history
- Keeps business cash available for operations.

---

## One-Sentence Summary

If a towing company already has a working fleet or strong business history, we may finance larger truck purchases with little or no down payment even without prior large loans.
