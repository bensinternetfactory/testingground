# Private Party Tow Truck Financing — Landing Page Copy

## SECTION 1: HERO

**Headline:**
> Found the perfect truck. The seller's not a dealer. Now what?

**Subheadline:**
> Private party tow truck financing for established operators who find their own deals.

**Supporting text:**
> Most lenders won't touch it. Banks want a dealer in the middle. But you found a truck that's right—from another towing company, an auction, a retiring operator. You shouldn't lose the deal because your financing can't keep up.

**CTA:**

## SECTION 2: THE PROBLEM

**Section header:**
> The dealer-only problem

**Body:**
> You know where the good deals are. They're not on dealer lots.

> They're from the operator down the road who's retiring. The auction where you spotted a low-mile flatbed. The company three towns over that's downsizing their fleet.

> But here's what happens when you try to finance a private party purchase:

> - Banks say no. Too much paperwork. Too much risk.
> - Big lenders require a dealer invoice. No dealer, no deal.
> - You're stuck choosing between dealer markup or paying cash you can't spare.

> Meanwhile, your competitor—the one with a lender who actually does private party—just bought the truck you wanted.

## SECTION 3: THE SOLUTION

**Section header:**
> We finance the truck, not the dealer relationship

**Body:**
> Tow Loans specializes in private party tow truck financing. That means:

> **You find the truck.** From another operator, auction, private seller—wherever the right deal is.

> **We handle the financing.** Same process as dealer purchases. Title verification, lien payoff coordination, funding directly to the seller.

> **You get the truck on your lot.** Without the dealer markup. Without draining your cash reserves.

> This is what we do. Tow truck financing for operators who know what they're looking for.

## SECTION 4: WHO THIS IS FOR

**Section header:**
> Built for operators who've proven themselves

**Body:**
> We're not the lender for first trucks and fresh starts. We work with established towing businesses looking to grow.

> **You're a fit if:**
> - 2+ years in business
> - Fleet of 3+ trucks
> - Credit score 640+
> - You've found (or are looking for) a truck from a private seller

> **This isn't for you if:**
> - You're buying your first truck
> - You need "bad credit" financing
> - You want a lender who'll say yes to anyone

> We work with operators who've earned access to better rates and real options. If that's you, let's talk.

## SECTION 5: HOW IT WORKS

**Section header:**
> From handshake to keys in 4 steps

**Step 1: Tell us about the truck**
> Year, make, mileage, asking price. We'll confirm it qualifies and give you a preliminary approval.

**Step 2: Send the basics**
> Business financials, equipment details, seller information. No 50-page applications. We know what we need.

**Step 3: We verify and structure**
> Title check, lien search, value confirmation. We coordinate with the seller so you don't have to play banker.

**Step 4: Fund and close**
> We pay the seller directly. You handle the handshake. Truck's on your lot.

**Timeline note:**
> Most deals close in 5-7 business days. Some faster if paperwork's clean.

## SECTION 6: WHAT YOU CAN FINANCE

**Section header:**
> If it tows, we finance it

**Body:**
> - Flatbeds and rollbacks
> - Wheel-lift wreckers
> - Heavy-duty wreckers
> - Rotators
> - Integrated tow trucks

## SECTION 7: WHY PRIVATE PARTY MAKES SENSE

**Section header:**
> The math favors operators who buy smart

**Body:**
> Dealer inventory is limited. Prices are marked up. And you're choosing from what they have, not what you need.

> Private party purchases flip that equation:

> - **Better selection.** Buy the exact truck you want, not what's on the lot.
> - **Better prices.** No dealer markup. Negotiate directly.
> - **Better timing.** Move when the deal appears, not when a dealer has inventory.

> The operators growing the fastest aren't waiting for dealers. They're finding trucks and financing them directly.

> The only thing that's been missing? A lender who makes it possible.

## SECTION 8: FAQS

**Section header:**
> Straight answers

**Q: What if the seller still has a loan on the truck?**
> We handle lien payoffs regularly. We verify the payoff amount, coordinate with their lender, and ensure clean title transfer. It adds a few days but doesn't change your process.

**Q: Do you require a down payment?**
> Typically 10-20% depending on the deal. Strong credit and financials can reduce this. We'll tell you upfront—no surprises at closing.

**Q: What rates should I expect?**
> Rates vary based on credit, time in business, and equipment. Established operators with good credit typically see rates between 8-12%. We'll give you a real number, not a teaser rate you'll never actually get.

**Q: How is this different from equipment financing through my bank?**
> Most banks won't finance private party purchases at all. The ones that do make it painful—extra documentation, longer timelines, lower approval rates. We've built our process specifically for this.

**Q: What if I find a truck but I'm not sure about the deal?**
> Call us anyway. We can give you a preliminary read on financing before you commit. No cost, no obligation.
