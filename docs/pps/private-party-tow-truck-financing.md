## Structure

### 1. Hook Intro (200 words)

Open with the answer, not the setup:

- Our approach: We finance the truck, not the dealer relationship
- Who this is for: Established operators who find their own deals

**Voice note:** Lead with their reality. "Found a truck from another towing company? A retiring operator? Facebook Marketplace? You can finance it."

### 3. How It Actually Works (600 words)

> H2: How Private Party Tow Truck Financing Works

Step-by-step (numbered list for snippet potential):

1. **You find the truck** — FB Marketplace, auction, another operator, wherever
2. **Send us the truck info** — We draft the bill of sale
3. **Provide title or e-title copy** — Seller needs to show proof
4. **Credit decision** — Same day possible
5. **Electronic docs** — Buyer AND seller sign electronically. Seller paperwork is minimal.
6. **We wire the funds** — Either direct to seller, OR to payoff bank + equity to seller
7. **Seller mails title, you pick up the truck**

**Sub-sections:**

**Same-day closing is possible**
If docs and insurance are ready, we can fund same day with a cooperative seller.

**Bank payoffs handled**
If seller has a loan, we wire to their lender, send equity to seller. 10-15 day payoff process.

**Seller involvement is minimal**
A few electronic signatures. That's it.

### 4. Real Example (300 words)

> H2: What a Private Party Deal Actually Looks Like

**The $57,000 Ram 5500 Rollback:**
- Customer found it on Facebook Marketplace
- Seller had clear title
- Customer signed docs electronically
- Seller completed minimal paperwork (10 minutes)
- Wire sent, title mailed, truck picked up

**Second scenario: Deals with bank payoffs**
- Seller still owes money on the truck
- We get 10-15 day payoff letter from their lender
- Wire payoff amount to bank
- Send remaining equity to seller
- Title released, deal done

**Voice note:** Specifics matter. "$57,000 Ram 5500" is credible. "A recent customer" is not.

### 5. Why Most Lenders Refuse (400 words)

> H2: Why Banks Won't Finance Private Party Tow Trucks

The honest reasons:

- **Title complexity** — Liens need verification, fraud risk without dealer buffer
- **Valuation difficulty** — No dealer invoice, lender has to pull comps manually
- **No dealer buffer** — No warranty, no inspection, no recourse if something's wrong
- **Manual process** — Every private party deal requires verification work most lenders won't do

**Position (without saying "we're different"):**

> We built processes to handle title verification, bank payoffs, and valuation on private party trucks. That's what we do.

### 6. Requirements (350 words)

> H2: Private Party Tow Truck Financing Requirements

**What you need:**
- Established towing business (not a startup)
- Good credit history
- Minimum deal size: $20,000
- **No truck age or mileage restrictions** — Early 2000s trucks, high-mileage workhorses, all fine

**What the seller needs:**
- Title or e-title (we verify it)
- Willingness to sign electronic docs
- If they have a loan: 10-15 day payoff letter from their lender

**Good fit for:**
- Heavy wreckers and rotators from other companies
- Older equipment that still runs great
- Auction purchases
- Retiring operator buyouts

**Voice note:** "No age or mileage restrictions" is a major differentiator. Most lenders cap at 10 years or 100K miles.

### 7. Deal Killers (400 words)

> H2: What Makes Private Party Deals Fall Through

Honest section — builds trust by acknowledging reality:

**#1: Impatient sellers**
- They want cash today, don't want to wait
- Financing takes a few days, not a few hours
- Solution: Set expectations with the seller before you commit
- Good news: Cooperative seller + ready docs = same-day close possible

**#2: Hidden liens**
- Seller thinks title is clear, but bank still has a claim
- We discover it during verification
- Solution: We can handle payoffs, but it adds time

**#3: Valuation gaps**
- Seller wants $80K, comps say $60K
- Lender runs ~5 comps on similar trucks
- Solution: Know the market before you negotiate

**Voice note:** "Impatient sellers" is the real #1 issue. Saying it builds credibility.

### 8. Private Party vs Dealer Comparison (400 words)

> H2: Private Party vs Dealer Financing: Which Is Right for You?

**Comparison table (featured snippet potential):**

| Factor | Private Party | Dealer |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Selection | Unlimited — anywhere you find it | Limited to their inventory |
| Price | Typically lower (no retail markup) | Retail pricing |
| Financing | Need a lender who does private party | Most lenders work with dealers |
| Speed | Depends on seller cooperation | Usually straightforward |
| Warranty | As-is, typically | Sometimes available |
| Inspection | You do your own due diligence | Dealer handles prep |

**When dealer makes sense:**
- Need the truck immediately
- Want a warranty
- Don't have time to verify condition yourself

**When private party wins:**
- Found a specific truck at a good price
- Buying from someone you know/trust
- Heavy equipment that rarely shows up at dealers

### 9. FAQ Section (500 words)

> H2: Frequently Asked Questions

Schema-ready format (H3 for each question):

**What if the seller has a loan on the truck?**
We handle it. The seller gets a 10-15 day payoff letter from their lender. We wire the payoff amount to their bank, send the remaining equity to the seller. Title gets released, deal closes.

**How do you determine what the truck is worth?**
The bank runs approximately 5 comps—similar trucks recently sold or currently listed. If the agreed price is within range, no issues. If it's way over market, we'll let you know.

**Does the seller need to be there or do a lot of paperwork?**
Minimal involvement. Everything's electronic. They sign docs, we wire funds, they mail the title. Maybe 15 minutes of their time total.

**How fast can you close?**
As fast as we get signed docs from you, signed docs from the seller, and proof of insurance. Same day is possible with a cooperative seller and clear title.

**Do you finance older trucks?**
Yes. No age or mileage restrictions. Early 2000s trucks, high-mileage equipment—if it runs and has value, we can finance it.

**What about trucks from auctions?**
Yes, we finance auction purchases. Same process—you provide the auction paperwork, we handle financing.

**Can I finance a heavy wrecker or rotator from a private seller?**
Yes. Actually a great use case. The $20K minimum means this works well for higher-value equipment like heavy wreckers, rotators, and other specialty trucks.

**What states do you cover?**
All 50 states.

## The Test

Before publishing, verify:

1. Would a tow operator read this and think "these people get it"?
2. Does it sound different from a bank's generic small business page?
3. Is every claim backed by specifics or experience?
4. Would we be comfortable if a skeptical customer read it closely?
5. Does it respect their intelligence and their time?
6. Would someone bookmark this? Share it?

If any answer is no, revise.
