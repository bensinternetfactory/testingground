## The Problem Section

**Header:** The Florida Tow Show Problem Nobody Talks About

5,000 people will walk the floor in Orlando this April.

Most of them will be browsers. They'll see the truck they want. They'll talk to the seller. They'll say "let me think about it" — and watch someone else drive it away.

Here's why:

- They don't know what they can actually spend
- They can't commit on the spot
- They're waiting on a bank that doesn't understand tow trucks

Meanwhile, the prepared buyer? He already knows his number. He negotiates. He closes. He's loading his new wrecker while everyone else is still "thinking about it."

**The question:** Which one will you be?

---

## The Offer Section

**Header:** Walk the Floor as a Buyer, Not a Browser

Get pre-approved before April 9th and you'll know exactly what you can spend — before you shake a single hand.

**What you get:**

- **$0 down** — Keep your cash for equipment, insurance, or working capital
- **No payments for 180 days** — Buy in April, first payment in October
- **Pre-approval in hand** — Walk the show floor ready to negotiate and close
- **Finance anything you find** — Dealer floor, auction, or private party sale

**The math:** Florida's busiest towing season runs June through November. Summer breakdowns. Hurricane season. That's 6 months of peak revenue before you make a single payment.

The truck pays for itself.

**CTA:** Get Your Pre-Approval

## Equipment Section

**Header:** We Finance What You Find

It doesn't matter where you buy it:

- **Dealer floor** — New or used from any manufacturer
- **Auction** — Live or online
- **Private party** — Another operator selling their rig

We've been financing tow trucks bought at the Florida Tow Show for years. Wreckers. Rollbacks. Rotators. Flatbeds. Light duty. Medium duty. Heavy duty.

If it tows, we finance it.

## The Transformation Section

**Header:** Before vs. After Pre-Approval

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "I need to check with my bank" | "I can spend up to $X" |
| Loses deals to faster buyers | Negotiates from strength |
| Worries about approval | Approved and ready |
| Browses the show floor | Buys at the show |

The best deals at the Florida Tow Show go fast. Rotators sell in hours, not days. That used heavy-duty wrecker priced right? Gone by lunch.

Pre-approved buyers don't miss out.

## Why This Offer Exists

**Header:** Why $0 Down and 180 Days Deferred?

We've been to the show. We know how it works.

You find the right truck. The price is good. But you're thinking about cash flow — the down payment, the monthly hit, whether you can swing it right now.

So we built an offer that removes the obstacle:

**$0 down** means you keep your capital.

**180 days deferred** means the truck works before you pay.

Buy it in April. Run calls all summer. Handle hurricane season. Build your revenue. Then start payments in October with money the truck already earned.

This isn't a gimmick. It's how smart operators think about equipment.

*"I'd been to three shows just looking. Finally got smart, got pre-approved, and walked out with a medium-duty wrecker. Should've done it years ago."*
— Carlos M., Orlando

*"The 180-day deferral was the difference. Used it all summer, had the money by the time payments started."*
