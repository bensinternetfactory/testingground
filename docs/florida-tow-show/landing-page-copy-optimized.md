## The Problem Section

**H2:** The Florida Tow Show Problem Nobody Talks About

5,000 people will walk the floor in Orlando this April.

Most of them? Browsers. They'll see the truck they want. Talk to the seller. Say "let me think about it" — and watch someone else drive it away.

Here's why:

- They don't know what they can actually spend
- They can't commit on the spot
- They're waiting on a bank that doesn't understand tow trucks

The prepared buyer already knows his number. He negotiates. He closes. He's loading his new wrecker while everyone else is still "thinking about it."

Which one will you be?

## The Offer Section

**H2:** Walk the Florida Tow Show as a Buyer, Not a Browser

Get pre-approved for tow truck financing before April 9th. Know exactly what you can spend before you shake a single hand.

**What you get:**

- **$0 down** — Keep your cash for equipment, insurance, or working capital
- **No payments for 180 days** — Buy in April, first payment in October
- **Pre-approval in hand** — Walk the floor ready to negotiate and close
- **Finance anything you find** — Dealer floor, auction, or private party sale

**H3:** The Math

Florida's busiest towing season runs June through November. Summer breakdowns. Hurricane season. That's 6 months of peak revenue before you make a single payment.

The truck pays for itself.

**CTA:** Get Your Pre-Approval

## Equipment Section

**H2:** We Finance Tow Trucks From Any Source

It doesn't matter where you buy:

- **Dealer floor** — New or used from any manufacturer
- **Auction** — Live or online
- **Private party** — Another operator selling their rig

We've been financing tow trucks bought at the Florida Tow Show for years.

**H3:** Equipment We Finance

| Type | Duty Class |
|------|------------|
| Wreckers | Light, Medium, Heavy |
| Rollbacks | Light, Medium, Heavy |
| Flatbeds | Light, Medium, Heavy |
| Rotators | Heavy |

New truck financing. Used tow truck financing. Wrecker financing. Rollback financing. Rotator financing.

If it tows, we finance it.

## Transformation Section

**H2:** Before vs. After Pre-Approval

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "I need to check with my bank" | "I can spend up to $X" |
| Loses deals to faster buyers | Negotiates from strength |
| Worries about approval | Approved and ready |
| Browses the show floor | Buys at the show |

The best deals at the Florida Tow Show go fast. Rotators sell in hours, not days. That used heavy-duty wrecker priced right? Gone by lunch.

Pre-approved buyers don't miss out.

## Why This Offer Section

**H2:** Why $0 Down and 180 Days Deferred?

We've been to the show. We know how it works.

You find the right truck. The price is good. But you're thinking about cash flow — the down payment, the monthly hit, whether you can swing it right now.

So we built an offer that removes the obstacle:

**$0 down** means you keep your capital.

**180 days deferred** means the truck works before you pay.

Buy it in April. Run calls all summer. Handle hurricane season. Build your revenue. Then start payments in October with money the truck already earned.

This isn't a gimmick. It's how smart operators think about equipment.
