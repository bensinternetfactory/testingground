   Bank runs approximately 5 comps — similar trucks recently sold or currently for sale. If price is in range, no issues.

   Minimal involvement. Electronic docs. They sign, we wire, they mail title.

   As fast as we get signed docs from customer, seller, and proof of insurance. Same day possible with a cooperative seller.
