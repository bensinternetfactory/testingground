# Tow Loans Voice Profile

## Voice Summary

Tow Loans sounds like the straight-talking friend in the industry who actually gets what it takes to run a tow business. We're the specialized lender who skips the corporate runaround and talks to operators like real people—direct, honest, and with genuine respect for the work they do. Think Carhartt meets Affirm: built for the trade, powered by modern simplicity.

## Core Personality Traits

- **Straight shooter:** We say what we mean. No fine print games, no hidden fees buried in legalese. If something's important, we tell you upfront.
- **Industry insider:** We know towing. We understand the difference between a flatbed and a wheel-lift, why a rotator is a big investment, and what it means when a busy week turns into a slow month.
- **Respectful partner:** We treat tow operators like the business owners they are—not like credit scores walking through the door. Your work matters, and so does your time.
- **Quietly confident:** We're specialists, not generalists. We don't need to shout about it. Our focus speaks for itself.

## Tone Spectrum

| Dimension | Position | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Formal ↔ Casual | Professional-casual | Approachable but not sloppy. Like a firm handshake, not a fist bump. |
| Serious ↔ Playful | Mostly serious, light touches | Money is serious. But we're not robots—occasional wit is welcome. |
| Reserved ↔ Bold | Confidently direct | We make clear claims without hedging. No "potentially" or "may help." |
| Simple ↔ Sophisticated | Plain-spoken | Real words, not finance-speak. Sophisticated understanding, simple delivery. |
| Warm ↔ Direct | Direct with warmth | Get to the point, but never cold. Respect their time AND their humanity. |

## Vocabulary

**Words/phrases to USE:**
- "Get you on the road" — ties financing to what matters (working trucks)
- "Built for tow operators" — emphasizes specialization
- "Straight answer" / "straight talk" — reinforces no-BS positioning
- "Your business" — acknowledges they're business owners, not just borrowers
- "Simple" / "clear" / "upfront" — transparency signals
- Industry terms when relevant (flatbed, wrecker, rotator, hook) — shows we know the business

**Words/phrases to AVOID:**
- "Easy approval" / "guaranteed" — sounds predatory, makes promises we can't always keep
- "Leverage" / "utilize" / "optimize" — corporate buzzwords
- "We're different" — generic claim, show don't tell
- "Family" (as in "the Tow Loans family") — overused, feels fake
- "Exciting opportunity" — marketing fluff
- "Subject to credit approval" in big text — necessary legally, but don't lead with the disclaimer

**Jargon level:** Moderate — use towing industry terms naturally, but keep financial terms simple

**Profanity:** Never. Professional, but not stiff.

## Rhythm & Structure

**Sentences:** Mix of short and medium. Short for punch ("No hidden fees."). Medium for explanation. Avoid run-ons.

**Paragraphs:** Keep them tight. 2-4 sentences max. White space is respect for busy people.

**Openings:** Lead with what matters to them. Not "At Tow Loans, we believe..." but "Need a new truck on your lot?"

**Formatting:**
- Clear headers that scan fast
- Bullet points for lists (rates, requirements, steps)
- Bold for key terms, not for emphasis on every other word
- No emojis in primary copy (maybe OK in casual social)

## POV & Address

**First person:** "We" — we're a team, a company, but a human one
**Reader address:** "You" — direct, personal
**Relationship stance:** Specialized partner. We're experts in our lane, you're experts in yours. Mutual respect.

## Example Phrases

**On-brand (sounds like us):**
- "You run a tow business. We finance tow businesses. Let's talk."
- "No corporate runaround. Just straight answers about what you qualify for."
- "We've seen every kind of tow operation—solo owner-operators to 50-truck fleets. We get it."
- "Your next truck shouldn't take 6 weeks of paperwork."
- "Built for the towing industry. That's all we do."

**Off-brand (doesn't sound like us):**
- "Experience the Tow Loans difference today!" — Generic, empty, sounds like everyone
- "We're passionate about empowering towing entrepreneurs to achieve their dreams." — Corporate fluff, trying too hard
- "EASY APPROVAL! Get your truck NOW! 🚛💰" — Predatory vibes, unprofessional
- "Pursuant to applicable lending regulations, qualified applicants may be eligible..." — Legalese-forward, impersonal
- "At Tow Loans, we understand that your business is more than just a job—it's your livelihood." — Cliché, overwrought

## Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- Lead with their reality (trucks, cash flow, growth) not our features
- Use industry terms naturally—it shows we know the business
- Be specific about numbers, rates, and timelines when possible
- Acknowledge the real challenges of running a tow operation
- Keep it scannable—they're busy, often reading on a phone between calls
- Sound like a person, not a brochure

**DON'T:**
- Make promises we can't keep (guaranteed approval, instant funding for everyone, lowest rate)
- Talk down to them or over-explain basic business concepts
- Use stock photo language ("partner with us on your journey")
- Hide important terms in fine print while shouting benefits
- Sound desperate for their business (pushy CTAs, countdown timers, fake urgency)
- Forget that behind every loan is someone's actual livelihood

## Application Notes

### Headlines
Keep them short, benefit-focused, and grounded in their world:
- "Financing for tow operators. That's it."
- "Get the truck. Skip the runaround."
- "Built for towing. Not a side hustle for a big bank."

### CTAs
Direct and low-pressure:
- "See what you qualify for"
- "Get a straight answer"
- "Talk to us"
- Avoid: "Apply NOW!" / "Don't miss out!" / "Limited time!"

### Email
Open with relevance, not "Hope this finds you well." Close with clear next step, not three options.

### Social
Can be slightly more casual. Industry humor OK if it's insider, not mocking. Still no emojis overload.

## The Test

Before publishing, ask:
1. Would a tow operator read this and think "these people get it"?
2. Does it sound different from a bank's generic small business page?
3. Is it honest? Could we back up every claim?
4. Would we be comfortable if a skeptical customer read it closely?
5. Does it respect their intelligence and their time?

If any answer is no, revise.
