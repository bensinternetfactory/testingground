# Rocket Mortgage Homepage Breakdown → Tow Truck Financing Adaptation

---

## Section 1: Sticky Navigation Bar

**What Rocket Mortgage has:**
- Logo (left)
- Nav links: Buy | Refinance | Rates | Loan options
- Phone number with click-to-call
- Sign in link
- "Apply now" CTA button (black, high contrast)

**Your tow truck financing version:**
- Your logo (left)
- Nav links: Financing | Programs | Resources
- Phone number with click-to-call (critical — tow truck operators call)
- "Apply Now" CTA button

**Why this works:** The sticky nav keeps the CTA visible at all times. Tow truck operators browsing on their phone between jobs can tap "Apply" or call instantly.

---

## Section 2: Hero Section

**What Rocket Mortgage has:**
- Scattered lifestyle photos (families, homes) in tilted card layout
- Small eyebrow text: "Lower rates unlock"
- Large headline: "new adventures"
- Single CTA button: "See what I qualify for"
- Clean white background, lots of breathing room

**Your tow truck financing version:**
- Hero image or photos of tow trucks (rollbacks, wreckers, rotators in action)
- Eyebrow text: "Tow Truck Financing for Growing Fleets"
- Headline: "How Many Calls Did You Turn Down Last Month?" (or "Get Your Next Truck on the Road This Week")
- CTA: "See What You Qualify For" or "Get Your Rate in Minutes"
- Keep the clean, open layout — don't clutter it

**Why this works:** Rocket Mortgage leads with emotional aspiration (new adventures). You lead with a pain point that established operators feel daily — turning down revenue. The CTA mirrors their qualifying language, which is proven to convert.

---

## Section 3: Quick Navigation Cards (3 cards)

**What Rocket Mortgage has:**
- 3 large clickable cards in a row:
  - "Buying →"
  - "Refinancing →"
  - "Today's rates →" (with a "Trending" badge)
- Minimal design, just text + arrow

**Your tow truck financing version:**
- 3 cards segmenting your audience by need:
  - "Finance a Truck →" (buying/leasing a new or used truck)
  - "Refinance Your Fleet →" (lower existing payments)
  - "Fleet Expansion →" (with a "Popular" badge — targets your ideal customer)
- OR segment by truck type:
  - "Rollbacks & Flatbeds →"
  - "Wreckers →"
  - "Heavy Duty & Rotators →"

**Why this works:** Lets visitors self-select immediately. Established operators expanding their fleet click "Fleet Expansion" and land on content built specifically for them. This pre-qualifies traffic before they even fill out a form.

---

## Section 4: Today's Pricing / Rate Ticker

**What Rocket Mortgage has:**
- Heading: "Check out today's pricing"
- CTA: "Get my custom rate"
- Horizontally scrolling rate cards showing loan types (30-year fixed, 30-year jumbo, FHA, etc.) with APR, rate, and points
- Compared week over week with green indicators
- Timestamp showing rates are current

**Your tow truck financing version:**
- dont want to include this section

**Why this works:** Showing real numbers builds trust and pre-qualifies leads. If someone sees "$1,200/mo for a rollback" and that's in their budget, they're more likely to apply. If it's not, they self-filter — saving you time.

**Note:** Only include pricing if you can keep it reasonably accurate. Outdated numbers hurt credibility. If rates change too frequently, skip this section or use ranges.

## Section 5: Loan Type Cards (3 cards with icons)

**What Rocket Mortgage has:**
- Heading: "Home loans for every goal-getter"
- 3 cards with icons, each targeting a different buyer:
  - "First-time buyer advantage" — 1% down, cash rewards
  - "Turn equity into cash" — Cash-out refinance
  - "Veteran benefits" — $0 down VA loans
- Each card has an arrow link to learn more

**Your tow truck financing version:**
- Heading: "Financing Built for Towing Professionals"
- 3 cards targeting your audience segments:
  - "Fleet Expansion" (icon: multiple trucks) — "Add trucks without draining cash flow. Competitive rates for established companies."
  - "New & Used Trucks" (icon: single truck) — "Finance your next rollback, wrecker, or rotator with terms that fit your business."
  - "Refinance & Save" (icon: dollar sign) — "Already financing a truck? See if you qualify for a lower payment."

**Why this works:** This mirrors Rocket's approach of segmenting by customer need, not by product feature. Each card speaks to a different motivation and routes traffic to the right conversion path.

---

## Section 6: Interactive Guide Builder

**What Rocket Mortgage has:**
- Heading badge: "Build your custom guide"
- Mad-libs style interactive sentence: "I'm [buying ▾] and I need help with [getting started ▾]"
- CTA: "Review my guide"
- Secondary link: "Not ready? Start by browsing homes"
- Lifestyle photos flanking the interactive area
- Warm beige background section

**Your tow truck financing version:**
- Heading: "Find Your Financing Match"
- Interactive sentence: "I need a [rollback ▾] and I want to [finance ▾] with [0-10% down ▾]"
  - Dropdown 1: Rollback / Wrecker / Rotator / Heavy Duty / Used Truck
  - Dropdown 2: Finance / Lease / Refinance
  - Dropdown 3: $0 down / 0-10% down / 10-20% down
- CTA: "See My Options"
- Secondary link: "Not sure? Talk to a financing specialist"

**Why this works:** This is an engagement tool that doubles as lead qualification. By the time they click "See My Options," you already know what truck they want, whether they want to buy or lease, and their down payment range. That's a warm lead before they even fill out a form.

**Build consideration:** This could be a simple multi-step form or a real interactive component. Even a static version that just routes to the right page would work.

## Section 7: Featured Programs / "New Ways to Save" (3 cards with images)

**What Rocket Mortgage has:**
- Heading: "New ways to save"
- 3 large cards with lifestyle photos + descriptions:
  - "Buy with Preferred Pricing" — lower rate or cash credits at closing
  - "Upgrade your mortgage" — rate alerts for refinancing
  - "Consolidate debt & save" — home equity for debt consolidation
- Each card has a CTA link (Learn more, Get rate alerts, See how it works)

**Your tow truck financing version:**
- Heading: "More Ways to Grow Your Fleet"
- 3 cards with tow truck imagery:
  - "Section 179 Tax Advantage" — "Write off up to $1.25M on your truck purchase this tax year." → Learn more
  - "Fleet Financing Programs" — "Bundle multiple units into one package for better rates and simpler payments." → See fleet options
  - "Quick Approval Process" — "Apply in minutes. Get approved in hours. Be driving in days." → Apply now

**Why this works:** These cards handle objections and highlight differentiators. The tax deduction card gives them a financial reason to act now. The fleet card targets your ideal customer. The speed card addresses the #1 frustration with bank loans.

---

## Section 8: Calculator CTA

**What Rocket Mortgage has:**
- Full-width colored card (beige/pink)
- Heading: "Calculate the possibilities"
- Subtext: "Use our calculator tools to estimate payments, see costs clearly, and make smarter moves."
- CTA: "Explore all calculators"
- Visual: Stacked calculator UI cards showing dollar amounts, percentages, payment breakdowns

**Your tow truck financing version:**
- Heading: "What Would Your Monthly Payment Be?"
- Subtext: "Estimate your payment on a new or used tow truck in seconds."
- CTA: "Try the Calculator" or "Calculate Your Payment"
- Visual: A clean calculator mockup showing a truck price, term, and monthly payment
- Could link to an actual interactive calculator page (great for SEO too — targets "tow truck financing calculator")

**Why this works:** Calculators are one of the highest-engagement tools in lending. They let prospects self-serve and fantasize about affordability. They also generate organic traffic from "tow truck payment calculator" searches.

---

## Section 9: Social Proof / Testimonials

**What Rocket Mortgage has:**
- Split layout:
  - Left: Dark maroon block with heading "Real neighbors. Real experiences."
  - Right: Trustpilot quote carousel (1 of 4), showing customer quote + name + Trustpilot logo
- Carousel arrows to browse testimonials

**Your tow truck financing version:**
- Left block heading: "Trusted by Towing Companies Nationwide" (or "Operators Who've Grown With Us")
- Right: Testimonial carousel with quotes from towing company owners
  - Include company size context: "— Mike R., Owner, 8-truck fleet, Texas"
  - Use Google Reviews, Trustpilot, or BBB logo for credibility
- If you don't have testimonials yet, use stats instead: "500+ trucks financed" / "$25M+ in tow truck financing" / "4.8 star average rating"

**Why this works:** Trust is the #1 barrier in equipment financing. Tow truck operators are skeptical of lenders. Specific testimonials from operators they can relate to (fleet size, state, truck type) break through that skepticism.

---

## Section 10: Final CTA / Value Props

**What Rocket Mortgage has:**
- Warm beige full-width background
- Left: Circular photo collage of diverse people
- Right: Heading "More solutions than ever before"
- 3 value props in a row:
  - "Lifetime savings" — rate drop alerts
  - "Preferred Pricing" — partner discount
  - "Proven results" — "Over 9 million mortgages closed"
- CTA: "See what I qualify for"

**Your tow truck financing version:**
- Heading: "Why Towing Companies Choose Us" or "Built for the Towing Industry"
- 3 value props:
  - "Fast Approvals" — "Most applications approved within 24 hours."
  - "Competitive Rates" — "Rates that reward your strong credit and business history."
  - "Industry Expertise" — "We understand towing. We've financed X+ trucks for companies like yours."
- CTA: "See What You Qualify For" (repeat the primary CTA — drives home the action)
- Image: Tow trucks in action, or a fleet shot

**Why this works:** This is the "one more push" section for people who've scrolled the whole page but haven't clicked. Reinforce why you're different, then hit them with the CTA one final time.

---

## Section 11: Legal Disclosures

**What Rocket Mortgage has:**
- Expandable "Important legal disclosures" accordion
- Fine print about rate terms, partner offers, and lending disclaimers

**Your tow truck financing version:**
