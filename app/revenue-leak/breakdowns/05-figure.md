- Social proof: N/A
- Form fields: N/A

# Global Notes

## Conversion Architecture Observations

1. **CTA Repetition Strategy:** Figure places "Find my HELOC rate" at least 6 times on the page (nav, hero, tab panel 1, dual CTA section, footer top, footer mid). This is excellent -- the Tow Loans version should replicate this frequency with the primary CTA ("Check Your Options" or "Get Pre-Qualified") appearing no fewer than 5 times on the page.

2. **Social Proof Layering:** Figure uses three tiers of social proof:
   - **Quantitative:** $20B+ unlocked, 253K+ households, 100% online
   - **Third-party authority:** BBB A+, Trustpilot 4.8, Money.com "Best of" badge
   - **Customer voice:** 4 testimonials + aggregate review count (4,250)
   The Tow Loans version should mirror this three-tier approach: (a) internal stats, (b) review platform badges, (c) named operator testimonials.

3. **Speed as Core Message:** Figure hammers speed repeatedly -- "5 minutes," "5 days," "fast," "lightning-fast." For tow operators, speed is even more critical because truck downtime = lost revenue. The Tow Loans version should lean into "48-hour funding" or "same-week funding" language and connect speed to revenue protection.

4. **Audience Bifurcation:** The dual CTA section (Section 08) splits consumers from partners. The Tow Loans version should do the same: operators vs. dealers. This is a high-value conversion opportunity because dealer partnerships create recurring deal flow.

5. **FAQ as Objection Handler:** The expandable FAQ section is strategically placed after the social proof and story sections -- for visitors who are interested but not yet convinced. For tow operators, the biggest objections are likely: (a) credit concerns, (b) down payment requirements, (c) used truck eligibility, (d) startup eligibility. The FAQ should address these directly.

6. **Technology as Trust Signal:** Figure's AI section is not just a feature list -- it translates technology into borrower benefits (faster, cheaper, simpler). The Tow Loans version should similarly translate any tech advantages into operator benefits, not technical jargon.

7. **Missing Elements Worth Adding:**
   - **Payment calculator / interactive tool:** Figure does not embed one on the homepage (they link to separate pages). A Tow Loans homepage could benefit from an inline "See Your Estimated Payment" widget showing monthly costs by truck type and term.
   - **Equipment-specific imagery:** Figure uses abstract illustrations. Tow Loans should show actual tow trucks -- operators connect with their equipment viscerally.
   - **Urgency/scarcity messaging:** Neither Figure nor the Tow Loans version uses urgency. Consider adding seasonal callouts (e.g., "Winter storm season is coming -- is your fleet ready?") or limited-time rate promotions.
   - **Video testimonial:** Figure includes a YouTube video link in their testimonial section (observed in the first page load). A 60-second video of a real tow operator talking about their financing experience would be extremely high-converting.

8. **Compliance Notes for Tow Loans:**
   - Never guarantee approval or specific rates
   - Use "as low as" language for rate mentions
   - Include "subject to credit approval" on all CTAs
   - "All credit considered" is compliant; "guaranteed approval" is not
   - Pre-qualification soft pull vs. full application hard pull distinction should be clear

## Design Inspiration Takeaways

- **Color palette:** Figure uses navy + purple accent + white. Tow Loans should consider a dark palette (charcoal/navy) with a bold accent (orange, yellow, or green) that signals action and energy.
- **Typography:** Figure uses large, confident headlines with ample whitespace. Replicate this -- avoid cramming.
- **Illustration style:** Figure's line-art illustrations are distinctive. Tow Loans could use a similar treatment with tow truck / equipment line art, or go photographic for more visceral impact.
- **Page rhythm:** Figure alternates between light and dark background sections, creating a natural visual rhythm that prevents scroll fatigue. Mirror this.
