# Global Notes

## Conversion Opportunities Identified

1. **ZIP Code / Micro-Commitment Entry**: GEICO's hero uses a simple ZIP code field as the initial micro-commitment. For Tow Loans, the equivalent is an equipment-type selector or a "How much do you need?" slider. The goal is the same: get a tiny commitment that funnels into the full application. Keep friction extremely low.

2. **Insurance Type Tiles = Equipment Type Tiles**: The 6-tile product selector in the hero is a brilliant self-segmentation tool. Tow Loans should mirror this with equipment categories (Flatbed, Wrecker, Wheel-Lift, Carrier, Repo, Fleet). Each tile should link to a targeted landing page with equipment-specific copy, rates, and terms.

3. **Existing Customer Self-Service**: GEICO dedicates a full section to existing customer actions (claims, policy access, roadside). This reduces support costs and improves retention. Tow Loans should offer an equivalent: account login, payment portal, document upload, and specialist contact.

4. **Stats Bar is Underutilized on Most Finance Sites**: GEICO's 3-stat trust bar (85 years, $900+ savings, 97% satisfaction) is simple and powerful. Most equipment finance sites skip this. Tow Loans should use a stats bar with funding volume, speed, and credit flexibility metrics.

5. **Mobile App / Calculator Promotion**: GEICO promotes their #1-rated app with a checklist of features. Tow Loans can mirror this with a payment calculator tool or borrower portal promotion. Interactive tools (calculators, pre-qualification) convert better than static content.

6. **Content Marketing Hub**: GEICO Living provides value-add content that builds SEO authority and keeps users engaged. Tow Loans should invest in a resource center with buying guides, credit tips, and fleet growth content. This targets operators who are researching but not ready to apply yet.

7. **Legal Disclaimers Are Well-Handled**: GEICO uses asterisks that reference a single disclaimer block at the bottom. This is clean and compliant. Tow Loans should do the same -- keep claims specific, source them, and footnote everything.

8. **Chat Widget for Instant Engagement**: The floating "Gabby" chat widget provides an always-available conversion path for users who have questions. Tow Loans should implement a similar persistent chat or callback widget, especially since equipment financing decisions often involve questions about terms, equipment eligibility, and credit requirements.

9. **Minimal Top Navigation**: GEICO uses only 3 nav items (Espanol, Log In, Menu). This is intentionally reductive -- it removes distractions and keeps focus on the hero CTA. Tow Loans should follow this pattern: minimize top nav, push everything into a hamburger menu, and keep the hero action front and center.

10. **Alert Banner as Promotional Real Estate**: GEICO uses the slim banner above the hero for a phishing awareness link. This is premium real estate that Tow Loans can use for time-sensitive promotions: show specials, event callouts (tow shows), or seasonal offers.

## Key Design Patterns to Replicate

- **Gecko = Mascot / Brand Character**: GEICO's Gecko adds warmth and memorability. Tow Loans may not need a mascot, but a strong brand visual (truck silhouette, hook icon, operator avatar) in the hero serves the same function.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: The hero doesn't show all form fields at once. ZIP code first, then product selection, then full quote. Tow Loans should use the same pattern: equipment type first, then loan amount, then full application.
- **Card-Based Product Grid**: The 4-card insurance product section is clean, scannable, and encourages exploration. Tow Loans should mirror this for equipment categories or financing programs.
- **Persistent Conversion Elements**: Between the hero CTA, the chat widget, and the secondary links, there's always a path to convert visible on screen. Tow Loans needs this same density of conversion touchpoints without feeling cluttered.
