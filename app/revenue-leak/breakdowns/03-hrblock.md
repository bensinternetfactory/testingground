# Global Notes

## Conversion Architecture Observations

1. **Tiered Self-Segmentation is Brilliant:** H&R Block's three-tier card approach (DIY / DIY + Pro Review / Full-Service) is a masterclass in self-segmentation. Tow Loans should mirror this exactly: Self-Serve Online / Online + Specialist Review / Full-Service Concierge. This lets visitors self-select by comfort level, deal size, and urgency.

2. **Speed as Primary Value Prop:** H&R Block leads with speed ("as little as one hour"). For tow operators, speed is equally critical -- every day without a truck is lost revenue. Lead with "funding in as little as 24 hours" and reinforce throughout.

3. **Dual Hero CTAs are Effective:** The "Work with a tax pro" / "File my own taxes" split immediately segments traffic. Mirror this with "Talk to a Specialist" / "Check Your Options Online" to capture both high-touch and self-serve preferences.

4. **Cross-Sell Strips Work Without Disrupting:** The Refund Advance banner and Spruce strip are natural extensions, not interruptions. Tow Loans equivalents: Quick-Fund bridge loans, repair/upfit credit lines, refinancing offers.

5. **Sticky Bottom Bar for Persistent CTA:** The fixed bottom banner is a proven pattern for maintaining conversion pressure. Use it for the soft-pull pre-qualification CTA -- low commitment, high curiosity.

6. **Social Proof with Guarantees:** Pairing volume stats ("22 million+") with guarantee badges and a testimonial carousel is a powerful trust trifecta. Tow Loans version should include: volume stat, three commitment badges, and a 6-slide testimonial carousel from real operators across different equipment types and credit situations.

7. **MyBlock Account Portal = Retention Engine:** Creating a logged-in dashboard builds switching costs and repeat engagement. A "My Tow Loans" portal where operators can track applications, upload docs, and view payment schedules would serve the same purpose.

8. **Disclaimers Are Well-Placed:** Asterisks on claims link to organized footnotes at page bottom. Essential for compliance in equipment financing where rate, term, and approval claims need qualification.

## Opportunities for Tow Loans to Improve on This Pattern

- **Add a Payment Calculator in the Hero or Tier Cards:** H&R Block does not have a calculator in their comparison section. Tow Loans can differentiate by embedding estimated monthly payment ranges in each tier card (e.g., "Payments from $XXX/mo on a $50K flatbed*").
- **Equipment-Specific Landing Pages:** H&R Block has a generic homepage. Tow Loans should link tier cards to equipment-specific pages (flatbed, wrecker, heavy-duty, etc.) for deeper relevance.
- **Add a "Why Tow Loans" Section:** H&R Block relies on their brand recognition. Tow Loans needs an explicit differentiator section: industry specialization, lender network breadth, all-credit-considered positioning, and fast funding.
- **Use Video Testimonials:** H&R Block uses text-only testimonials. Video testimonials from real tow operators with their trucks would be significantly more compelling.
- **Leverage Urgency More Aggressively:** H&R Block uses seasonal urgency ("Available through March 15"). Tow Loans can use situational urgency: "Every day without a truck costs you $X in lost calls" or "End-of-quarter lender incentives -- apply by [date]."
